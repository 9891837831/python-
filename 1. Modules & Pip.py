# Sometimes we have to use someone else’s code in our program 
# because it saves our lot of time and off-course it is legal and free.

#### Modules ####

# i.e. there is no need to download them before using. 
# These modules come with python interpreter itself.

# Example – random module, winreg, etc.

# External Modules –
# These are those modules which are not pre-installed in python 
# i.e. we need to download them before using in our program.
