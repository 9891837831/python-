#### Python as a Calculator :

## First of all I would like to tell one thing 
# i.e. the main motive of using Python is not to do calculations, 
# yeah that’s true Python is not just limited to do calculations. 
# It has vast no. of uses and has many merits or advantages. 
# Using Python you can do anything, literally saying anything 
# such as creating games, apps, software’s, websites, etc. 

# To do calculation in Python, 
# open Windows PowerShell and in that type python to open Python interpreter. 

# >>> 4 + 8
# 12
# >>> 5*7
# 35

#  Then simply type or put whatever mathematical calculation you want to do.
